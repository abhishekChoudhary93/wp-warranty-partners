					<h2 style="margin-top: -2%; margin-bottom: 5%;">Why Buy an
						Extended Service Plan?</h2>
				</center>
				<p style="color: #16214e; font-size: 120%;">The final question
					you'll be asked when buying an item is generally, "Would you like a
					service plan with that?" Shoppers typically decline such warranties
					due to the fact that they "never buy warranties". Most buyers
					should, however, consider the extended warranty as in the long run
					it will end up saving you a great deal of time and money. In most
					HDTV cases it will save you from purchasing an entire new unit.
					According to the March 2008 issue of Consumer Reports, the
					overwhelming majority of HDTVs usually do not need repair during
					the standard 1 year manufacturer warranty period. However, they do
					tend to need repairs within their total usage time. Rear-projection
					HDTVs and PROJECTORS do exhibit a higher rate of failure due to the
					fact that they work with a BULB, which will eventually die out
					(normally within the first 1-2 years of usage). Plasma TVs tend to
					leave a ghost effect over time and eventually run out of gas. LCD
					and LED TVs have been found to deliver the longest life usage,
					however they are most likely to acquire burned out pixels after the
					manufacturer warranty. Dead pixels are Formed Dots going across the
					LCD screen that can easily disrupt the picture. They appear to be
					small particles on the screen and can have a significant adverse
					effect on viewing.</p>
				<p style="color: #16214e; font-size: 120%;">So you may still be
					asking yourself, "What are the benefits to purchasing an extended
					service plan?”</p>
				<p style="color: #16214e; font-size: 120%;">These benefits will
					justify an Extended Warranty:</p>

						Coverage VS. Manufacturer coverage</h3>
					<p class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls" style="color: #16214e;">So
						your total coverage time is the Manufacturer Service period +
						Extended Service period, with the same coverage throughout. These
						service plans cover the units in the EXACT SAME way the
						manufacturers do. They cover everything except physical damage to
						the unit itself, caused by the consumer.</p>

					<h3 class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls">&#9989; In Home Coverage</h3>
					<p class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls" style="color: #16214e;">The
						Television will not have to leave your location. An authorized
						repair facility will send one of their highly trained technicians
						to your location, to assess the issue. They will then order the
						required parts, and service your television on site. There is no
						shipping to be done on your part, and you do not have the worry of
						bringing a cumbersome TV into a repair facility.</p>

					<h3 class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls">&#9989; Authorized Expert
						Service</h3>
					<p class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls" style="color: #16214e;">The
						Extended Warranty utilizes the exact same professional, highly
						trained techs as all of the big Manufacturers. These service plans
						actually utilize the exact same Authorized Technicians as the
						manufacturers themselves. If something goes wrong with your unit
						within the Manufacturer Warranty period, they will send out a
						technician from one of their authorized centers. They do not send
						out technicians from their "factory", but an expertly trained
						facility which they allow to do repairs under their banner. You
						can rest assured that your unit is in good hands.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3 class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls">&#9989; Cost of getting an
						HDTV repaired with no service plan</h3>
					<p class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls" style="color: #16214e;">Numerous
						studies show that repairs can cost between 40-70 percent of the
						unit’s original price. The cost of getting one of these units
						repaired is exorbitant amount of money. Aside from the trouble of
						taking a unit into a service center (which if you have a 50 inch
						TV or above, is very difficult), or shipping the unit to such a
						facility (which would cost hundreds of dollars), the cost of
						repairing such a unit is so expensive that you might as well just
						buy a new unit. Buying a service plan at a fraction of the price
						of your unit cost will save a huge amount of money and hassle.
						These plans are worry free.</p>

							Coverage</h3>
					</center>
					<p class="w3layouts w3 w3l w3ls" style="color: #16214e;">The
						good news is that in that event, your unit will be replaced by a
						newer model that meets or exceeds the specifications of your
						current model. One of the most important things to consider while
						purchasing an extended service plan is what will happen if a
						technician cannot repair your unit. In this case, they will
						replace your unit with the same exact model that you purchased
						(you will never receive a refurbished unit). With the constant
						evolution of HDTV technology, within the span of your extended
						service plan, the TV you initially purchased will become
						unavailable. This is due to the fact that as time goes by, the
						technology gets rounded, and ultimately more inexpensive to
						produce. This results in you getting a better unit, because it
						will be produced for a similar price as the unit you already
						owned. You will never be replaced with a lower end unit. This is a
						great benefit.</p>

					<p style="color: #16214e;">Again, after spending hundreds or

						event that something goes wrong with your expensive TV – with
						exponentially less time, money and hassle.</p>
